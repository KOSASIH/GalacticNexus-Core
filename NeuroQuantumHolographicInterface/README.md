Neuro-Quantum Holographic Interface
================================

This repository contains a neuro-quantum holographic interface that integrates a quantum computing model and a holographic display model to process input data.

The interface consists of multiple components, including input preprocessing, quantum computing processing, holographic display processing, and post-processing to display the hologram.

The code is organized into three files:

* `holographic_display_model.py`: defines the holographic display model
* `holographic_display.py`: defines the holographic display interface
* `neuroquantum_holographic_interface.py`: defines the neuro-quantum holographic interface

To run the code, you will need to install the required dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`. You can do this by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

Once the dependencies are installed, you can run the code by executing `python neuroquantum_holographic_interface.py`.

Note you may need to modify it to suit your specific needs.
