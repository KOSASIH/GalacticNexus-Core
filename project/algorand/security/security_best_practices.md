# Security Best Practices for Galactic Nexus

## General Security Practices
- **Keep Dependencies Updated**: Regularly update libraries and dependencies to their latest versions to mitigate known vulnerabilities.
- **Use Environment Variables**: Store sensitive information such as API keys and private keys in environment variables instead of hardcoding them in the codebase.
- **Implement Access Controls**: Ensure that only authorized users have access to sensitive functions and data.

## Code Security
- **Input Validation**: Always validate and sanitize user inputs to prevent injection attacks.
- **Error Handling**: Avoid exposing sensitive information in error messages. Use generic error messages for users.
- **Logging**: Implement logging to monitor access and changes to sensitive data, but ensure that logs do not contain sensitive information.

## Regular Audits
- **Conduct Regular Security Audits**: Schedule regular audits using tools like Bandit and Safety to identify vulnerabilities.
- **Penetration Testing**: Consider hiring external security experts to perform penetration testing on the application.
