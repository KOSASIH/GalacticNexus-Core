# Galactic Nexus: Real-World Asset Tokenization and Trading Platform

Galactic Nexus is a decentralized platform that enables the tokenization and trading of real-world assets such as real estate, commodities, and securities on the blockchain. The platform uses the Algorand SDK to interact with the Algorand blockchain and retrieve market data.

## Requirements

* Algorand SDK
* Flask
* Pandas
* Python 3.8+

2. Install the requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Set up an Algorand node and create a wallet
4. Update the `utils/config.py` file with your Algorand API key and mnemonic phrase
