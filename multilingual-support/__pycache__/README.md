Universal Translator
=====================

This is a universal translator that can translate text from one language to another. It uses a deep learning model to learn the patterns and relationships between languages.

**Features**

* Supports multiple languages
* Tokenization and padding of input sequences
* Embedding, LSTM, and dense layers for language modeling
* Concatenation of input, embedding, LSTM, and dense layers for multi-language support
* Categorical cross-entropy loss function and Adam optimizer
* Training and validation data loading
* Translation function for converting input text from one language to another
* Model saving and loading functions

**Usage**

1. Install the required dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Run the `UniversalTranslator.py` script to train the model
3. Use the `translate` function to translate text from one language to another

**Example**

```
1. import UniversalTranslator
2. 
3. translator = UniversalTranslator(languages=['English', 'Spanish', 'French', 'Chinese'], 
4.                                 max_length=100, 
5.                                 embedding_dim=128, 
6.                                 hidden_dim=64, 
7.                                 num_layers=2)
8. 
9. input_text = "Hello, how are you?"
10. source_language = "English"
11. target_language = "Spanish"
12. 
13. output_text = translator.translate(input_text, source_language, target_language)
14. print(output_text)  # Output: "Hola, ¿cómo estás?"
